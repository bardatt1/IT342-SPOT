- Adding user-friendly features for student management
- Improving data display and visualization
- Fixing UI/UX issues in various components

[2025-04-30 19:52:00] - Teacher Interface Enhancements

We've implemented several key improvements to the teacher interface:

1. **Class Code Generation** - Teachers can now generate unique enrollment keys (class codes) for their sections with a single click. This feature:
   - Creates a random 6-character alphanumeric code
   - Updates the section with the new code via API
   - Provides visual feedback with success messages
   - Includes copy-to-clipboard functionality for easy sharing

2. **Seat Management Improvements** - Enhanced the seat management interface to show detailed student information:
   - Fixed issue where occupied seats showed empty student names
   - Implemented proper student data handling to display full names
   - Added fallback to "Unknown Student" when data is unavailable
   - Improved warning messages when reassigning occupied seats

3. **UI Improvements** - Made several UI enhancements:
   - Updated section displays to show course code instead of course ID in dropdowns
   - Added success notifications for user actions
   - Improved visual feedback for copy-to-clipboard operations
   - Enhanced loading states for asynchronous operations

[2025-04-27 23:47:14] - Authentication and Navigation Flow

We have successfully addressed the authentication and login redirection issues in the application. The main problems we solved were:

1. JWT token handling - The tokens from the backend only contained minimal information (email, iat, exp) without the necessary role and user ID data needed for authorization
2. Login redirection - Users weren't being properly redirected to their role-specific dashboards after successful login
3. Authentication persistence - The authentication state wasn't properly maintained between page refreshes

Our solution implements a hybrid approach that:
- Extracts basic info from JWT tokens
- Makes API calls to get complete user data when needed
- Implements robust fallback mechanisms for error scenarios
- Uses direct browser navigation for more reliable redirects

The application now correctly:
- Authenticates users with email/password
- Extracts user role information from responses
- Redirects to the appropriate dashboard based on role
- Maintains authentication state across page refreshes

[2025-04-27 23:56:45] - API Endpoint Standardization

We've successfully addressed the API endpoint issues that were causing 500 errors:

1. **Root Cause**: Frontend API calls were using singular resource names while backend expected plural forms
   - Frontend was using: `/section`, `/student`, `/course`, `/teacher` 
   - Backend expected: `/sections`, `/students`, `/courses`, `/teachers`

2. **Solution**: Updated all API service modules to use the correct endpoint paths
   - Fixed section, student, course, and teacher API endpoints to use plural forms
   - Updated attendance API to use correct endpoints based on backend documentation
   - Fixed seat management API endpoints for picking and overriding seats
   - Removed unused parameters to resolve TypeScript warnings

3. **Current Status**: The API services now match the backend endpoint naming conventions. This should resolve the 500 errors we were seeing on the dashboard after login.

[2025-04-28 00:13:06] - API Authorization Solutions

We've made significant progress in addressing the API authorization and connectivity issues:

1. **Enhanced Error Handling**: We've improved the axiosInstance.ts file to include more detailed error logging for API requests. This will help us diagnose the specific causes of API errors.

2. **JWT Token Analysis**: We've examined the backend JWT implementation and discovered that:
   - The JWT token only contains the username (email) in claims, with no role information
   - This confirms why our frontend needs to make additional API calls to get complete user data
   - The token is properly validated by the JwtAuthenticationFilter on the backend

3. **AuthContext Improvements**: We've enhanced the AuthContext to:
   - Handle token validation more gracefully with improved error handling
   - Add a buffer period to token expiration checks to avoid edge cases
   - Implement a special refreshUserData function to update user information without a full login
   - Create more robust fallback mechanisms when API calls fail

4. **TypeScript Compatibility**: We've fixed several TypeScript errors related to our User interface changes:
   - Updated the DashboardLayout to use the 'name' property instead of 'firstName' and 'lastName'
   - Modified the ProtectedRoute component to use string type for roles instead of enum values
   - Fixed test components to reflect the updated User interface structure

5. **CORS Configuration**: We've observed that the backend has CORS configured to allow requests from all origins, which might introduce security concerns in production.

[2025-04-27 23:50:15] - API Authorization Issues

We've identified several API issues after successful login:

1. **401 Unauthorized Error**: When AuthContext initializes, it attempts to make a POST request to `/api/auth/login` to fetch user data based on the email extracted from the JWT token. This request is failing with a 401 error.

2. **500 Internal Server Errors**: Multiple API endpoints are returning 500 errors when the dashboard tries to fetch data:
   - GET `/api/section` - 500 error
   - GET `/api/student` - 500 error
   - GET `/api/course` - 500 error
   - GET `/api/teacher` - 500 error

This suggests our authentication flow has succeeded in getting the user to the correct dashboard, but there may be issues with how API requests are being authorized after login.

## Authentication System Redesign
[2025-04-28 00:31:36] - Moving to Direct Database Authentication
- Removing all token bypass mechanisms completely
- Implementing proper database-driven authentication
- Enhancing token validation with better error handling
- Using proper JWT token processing for authentication state

## Code Quality and Linting
[2025-04-28 00:35:27] - Fixing linting issues
- Addressing Tailwind CSS directive warnings in index.css
- Removing unused variables and imports in Login.tsx
- Creating proper configurations for CSS and JavaScript linting

## Recent Changes
- Implemented comprehensive error handling with ErrorBoundary components and hooks
- Set up unit testing infrastructure with Jest and React Testing Library
- Created tests for ErrorBoundary, useErrorHandler hook, Button component, and AuthContext
- Added test utilities for mocking browser APIs and handling common test scenarios
- Created setup files for consistent test environment across the application
- Configured advanced component error handling with fallback UI components
- Implemented pattern for handling both sync and async errors using custom hooks

## Open Questions/Issues
- Some CSS linting warnings remain but don't affect functionality
- Need to implement unit tests for components
- Production deployment strategy needs to be defined
- Need to determine how to test error boundaries effectively
- Student mobile interface requirements and implementation approach

## Next Steps
- Set up Jest and React Testing Library for unit testing
- Create test files for critical components (Auth, Dashboard, ErrorBoundary)
- Implement API mocking for component tests
- Set up continuous integration pipeline
- Add comprehensive documentation for API integration
- Create detailed project README with setup instructions
